# PixPro4kRealtime
This is a set of Unity assets to play webcam textures captured by fisheye cameras like Kodak PIXPRO360 4K. 

## How to use
Locate this directory under the Assets directory of your Unity project.   
Scenes/PixPro4kDemo.unity is a sample scene.   
If you locate Prefabs/PixPro4kSphere.prefab at your scene, you can locate a reversed sphere and project your connected fisheye camera image on the inside of it.
